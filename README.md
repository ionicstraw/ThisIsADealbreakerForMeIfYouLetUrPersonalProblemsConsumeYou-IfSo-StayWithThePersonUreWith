# ThisIsADealbreakerForMeIfYouLetUrPersonalProblemsConsumeYou-IfSo-StayWithThePersonUreWith

u do not want to be 65 yrs old, white/grey hair all over, chain smoking outside a wawa, filled with regret over not being able to HANDLE ur personal problems well bc it'll be too late, no one can help u at that point

and i am not just going to walk away from you, im going to run away from you like u have the plague in a split second

i can be alone, idc

see now u learned something, who u choose to be with, influences ur reputation and other people's trust in who and what you are and what you can become

when i met u, i thought you could do anything u wanted in the world. but now, im like why did u make these poor choices and its like, are you going to continue to do that?

so i dont know, i dont know enough about the situation and i dont know where this is headed, those are some very poor choices you made if u wanted to be with me the entire time, its a bad look for you, it really is
